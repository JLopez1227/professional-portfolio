# Professional Portfolio

##
 In this project I was tasked with making a Professional Portfolio from scratch. I used HTML to structure my page, added a functioning Nav Bar, a place holder image for my recent picture, also a link to my previous work. I added a Resume section, an About Me section, and a Contact Information section.

###
 I used CSS to style my portfolio giving it a colored background, a fancy font to make it look professional, as well as trying the portfolio look as best as it can.
